# Shit I Should Do

## Small things
- [x] Fix bug when in hamburger menu mode, create blogs and profile pic is visible even when not logged in
- [x] make the search input more smaller in hamburger mode.
- [x] remove the bright green button for search in the search field. use a neutral icon instead.
- [x] Move the Sign out and Profile controls to the hamburger menu. they take too much space.
- [ ] when hovered over the profile icon (for now just use a placeholder image) there should be a cursor.


## Large things below
- [ ] for desktop version, when clicking, it should have a small drop down menu showing two links. Account and Sign Out.


## Refine the footer subscribe

- Make the ufo2 image go behin IM DONE WITH THIS. THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
- Make it white and transparent IM DONE WITH THIS. THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
- If the user is already logged in, just hide it, by default we will use their email.
- If the user isn't logged in, it will be a simple email collection form.

## Login or Sign Up pages

- Create another app for django? call it users.
  - Database model will include
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - email
    - password
    - is_subscribed
    - and in the future, maybe a link to the profile picture. for now, in the readblog, it will have a placeholder picture.

- Create a template for login
- Create a template for sign up
