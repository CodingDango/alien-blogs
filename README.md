# Shit I Should Do

## Large things below

## Header

- Implement the search pop up on desktop mode.


## Refine the footer subscribe

- Make the ufo2 image go behin IM DONE WITH THIS. THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
- Make it white and transparent IM DONE WITH THIS. THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH
- If the user is already logged in, just hide it, by default we will use their email.
- If the user isn't logged in, it will be a simple email collection form.

## Login or Sign Up pages

- Create another app for django? call it users.
  - Database model will include
    - username
    - email
    - password
    - is_subscribed
    - and in the future, maybe a link to the profile picture. for now, in the readblog, it will have a placeholder picture.

- Create a template for login
- Create a template for sign up

- Remember, in the nav. if the user is logged in, show a log out. if they aren't logged in, show login and sign up links.

## Read blog page

- Make the dates more dynamic
  - The author needs to also be dynamic.
  - Right now, it looks so damn dull. Only white colors. how in the world do i give it color to the text? this is ass.
